The Factorial of a positive integer N refers to the product of all number in the range from 1 to N. • Roy wants to change his profile picture on Facebook. Now Facebook has some restriction over the dimension of picture that we can upload. Minimum dimension of the picture can be L x L, where L is the length of the side of square. Now Roy has N photos of various dimensions. Dimension of a photo is denoted as W x H where W - width of the photo and H - Height of the photo • When any photo is uploaded following events may occur: [1] If any of the width or height is less than L, user is prompted to upload another one. Print \"UPLOAD ANOTHER\" in this case.\n",
